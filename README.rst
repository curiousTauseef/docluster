**Docluster** is an open source project that aims to bring the natural language processing community together. With increasing processing and advanced machine learning algorithms, NLP became a hot topic recently. Lots of research project are being conducted simultaniously. Keeping up with these advancements is nearly impossible for an individual. Doculuster tries to bring all studies in all countries into a library that can be easily utilized. 

**You want to contribute? Great! See Contribute_ section.**

* Free software: MIT license
* Built with: Python 3 - numpy, pandas, matplotlib

Vision
-------

Natural lanaguage processing space is populated with many individual and oragnizational projects that provide specific needs of consumer. Unfortunately none of these projects serve future innovation. Docluster aims to fill this void by being:

**Free:** Many projects that provide powerful NLP tools come with a price attach to it (usually a monthly subscription or a per request). Even seeing the 'Pricing' tab on a website providing these tools, discourages many people geniuly interested to contribute and prevents them from getting their hands dirty. Docluster aims to break this wall and open up many other innovations.

**Up-to-date on research:** NLP and machine learning became the hot topic of our generation. Therefore, there are so many research projects conducted that it is almost impossible to keep up. These projects are usually presented through a white paper and occasionally a repo. Docluster aims to keep people up-to-date by bringing tools in a sigular repo.

**Open to contributions:** Large organizations such as Google, Facebook, MIT are the leading most of the research projects in NLP. However, there are many individuals who are doing same kind of research or seeking to contribute and learn in the process. Docluster aims to be a platform for these individuals. The contributors that implement pre-existing models will have their name on the files that they have contributed. Individuals with a completely new model inveted by them will get full credit for their work as well as the implementation credit.

**All-language support:** Launguage is a big factor in NLP. Most of the efforts are put into more common languages like English. The projects described in section **Free**, usually only support a few of the languages. However, there are research projects in other languages as well. Docluster tries to join all these research projects by inviting people from all around the world to contribute to the support of their own native language.

**Easy to use:** Many NLP models require some sort of training step before any usage. Docluster gives the user the option to train their models or use a pre-trained model. It comes with a pre-trained model catalog where users can programmatically download or upload pre-trained model.

Features
---------

* Most recent research models as well as standard ones like Tf-Idf

* Pre-trained models catalog

* Flow - A pipelining tool where the graph doesn't need to be a chain.

* All-languages support

* Built in visualization


Installation
-------------

**The project is under heavy construction currently.**
