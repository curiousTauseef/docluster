# Model Implementation

Before you start implementing your model please make sure that the model in your mind is not implemented inside *docluster/models*. Note that there might be models that have a file but not implemented. Please read the Code Style guideline, if you haven't already. Thank you :)

## Steps to follow:

1) Create a file with filename being the name of your model. The filename should be all lowercase and shouldn't have any underscores.

2) Copy and paste the following template from [model template](./model_template.py).

3) Create a test file in tests/models/<the type of the model> with naming convention of **test_yourmodelname.py**.

4) Copy and paste following template from [test template](./test_template.py).
